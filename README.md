## Welcome

_Welcome to "Working with forks"! :wave:_

When collaborating on a project, you will often not have write access to that project's repository. However, forks allow you to still contribute code to the project without having special access to that repository! 

- **Who is this for**: Developers, new GitHub users, users new to Git, students, managers, teams.
- **What you'll learn**: How to use forks to make changes to code that you don't have write access to.
- **What you'll build**: We'll be creating a fork of a simple repository with a README file.
- **Prerequisites**: We assume you are familiar with creating repositories, pushing changes, creating a branch, rebasing/merge conflicts, and pull requests.
- **How long**: This course takes less than 30 minutes to complete.
  
In this course, you will:

1. Create a fork of a simple repository with a README file
2. Make changes to a branch in that fork and push those changes
3. Submitting a pull request with your fork
4. Retrieve new changes.

### How to start this course
[![start-course](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/235727646-4a590299-ffe5-480d-8cd5-8194ea184546.svg)](https://github.com/new?template_owner=e-perl-NOAA&template_name=test-skills-training-template&owner=%40me&name=e-perl-NOAA-test-skills-training-template&description=My+clone+repository&visibility=public)

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
