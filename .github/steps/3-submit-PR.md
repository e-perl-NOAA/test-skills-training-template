_Nice work making changes to the README.md file :sparkles:_

TBD-step-3-information

**What is _pull request_?**: Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes that you have made in the branck in your fork to other people. This pull request is going to keep the changes you just made in your branch in your fork and propose applying them to the `main` branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Submit changes from your fork to the main branch of the original repository in a pull request

1. In your forked repository, click where it says `Main` in the top left corner or click where is says a number of branches, and select your branch.
2. The click the button that says `Contribute` and click on the green button that says `Open a pull request`
3. On the screen it will show the branch in your fork (on the right) that you want to merge onto the main branch in the original repository (on the left). Double check that this is correct.
4. Add a short but descriptive title and then a description of the changes that you have made in the `Add a description` box. Pull requests (PR) are also written in markdown so if there are links, images, files, etc. that you would like to add, you can do that within the PR description.
5. Click the green button that says `Create pull request`.
6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
