## Step 2: Edit the README.md file in your fork

_Great job making a fork! :tada:_

**What is README.md file_?**: You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project. A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions. A README file is written in Markdown language. For more information, read the [GitHub Docs page about README files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit the README.md file in your fork

1. Scroll down on your fork repository to the [README](https://github.com/e-perl-NOAA/build-admb-ss3-docker#) and click on the ✏️ icon on the top right that will allow you to edit the file.
2. Under [Simple Usage](https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-concepts/building-images/understanding-image-layers/), edit the first sentence to add a hyperlink to [a guide on understanding what Docker images are](https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-concepts/building-images/understanding-image-layers/) and a hyperlink to [download Docker Desktop](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=dd-smartbutton&utm_location=module&_gl=1*y6h2yn*_gcl_au*MzA0NzU5NjY2LjE3MTkzMjc0OTY.*_ga*MTczMzM2MTQwNy4xNzE5MzI3NDk2*_ga_XJWPQMJYHQ*MTcxOTMyNzQ5Ni4xLjEuMTcxOTMyNzcxMy42MC4wLjA.). That sentence will go from this:
   
   ```To use this Docker image locally you will need to have Docker Desktop installed on your computer (if you are with NMFS, this will likely involve IT).```
   
   to the following:
   
   ```To use this [Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-concepts/building-images/understanding-image-layers/) locally you will need to have [Docker Desktop](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=dd-smartbutton&utm_location=module&_gl=1*1u1j0ws*_gcl_au*MzA0NzU5NjY2LjE3MTkzMjc0OTY.*_ga*MTczMzM2MTQwNy4xNzE5MzI3NDk2*_ga_XJWPQMJYHQ*MTcxOTMyNzQ5Ni4xLjEuMTcxOTMyNzcxMy42MC4wLjA.) installed on your computer (if you are with NMFS, this will likely involve IT).```
   
6. Click on the green button in the upper right hand corner that says `Commit changes...`.
7. Write a commit message that is descriptive of the change that you made
8. Click "Create a new branch..." and add a descriptive name to that branch with no spaces, something like `add-docker-links-to-readme`
9. Click `Commit changes`
10. This will commit changes onto a branch of your fork. Alternatively you could make the commit onto main of your fork but it's generally best practice to use feature branches to make changes.
11. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
